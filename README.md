# random-quote-web-app

This project provides a minimal Node.js setup for a random quote web application.  It forms the starting point for **Quantum Lingua**, an initiative to blend immersive language learning with metaphysics and AI.  See `APP_VISION.md` for a deeper look at the longâ€‘term vision and the Sentinel Assistant Protocol privacy model.
