# Sentinel Assistant Protocol

## Privacy Principles
- All data is stored locally and encrypted using **AES-256**.
- No data is shared externally unless explicitly enabled by the user.
- Every data access or deletion is logged to create a full audit trail.
- Users can delete or redact any stored data at any time.
- An emergency "delete all" option provides a panic wipe capability.

## Security Practices
- All APIs require authentication before access is granted.
- Encryption keys are unique to each user and are never transmitted.
- Third-party integrations are sandboxed and strictly opt-in.

## Threat Mitigation
- Authentication endpoints implement brute-force protection.
- Continuous monitoring helps detect data leaks or anomalies.
